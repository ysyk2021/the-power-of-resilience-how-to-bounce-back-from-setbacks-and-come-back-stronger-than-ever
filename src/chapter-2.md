Practicing gratitude involves recognizing and being thankful for the good things in life. This can help individuals develop a positive, optimistic attitude and increase resilience.

### Set Realistic Goals

Setting realistic goals involves breaking down larger goals into smaller, achievable steps. This can help individuals develop a growth mindset and build resilience by focusing on progress rather than perfection.

### Embrace Challenges as Opportunities for Growth

Embracing challenges as opportunities for growth involves reframing setbacks and obstacles as learning experiences. This can help individuals develop a growth mindset and increase resilience.

Cultivating self-compassion involves treating oneself with kindness, understanding, and non-judgment in the face of difficulties. This can help individuals build resilience by increasing self-awareness and promoting emotional regulation.
